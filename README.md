# Arduinoflake

Another decorative PCB? No! Arduinoflake is not only a decoration. It is also a badge, toy, learning kit, game or whatever your imagination can think of. Arduinoflake is Arduino IDE compatible, make it a unique, unleash your imagination.



Arduinoflake is a beautiful frozen looking snowflake. It has 18 wide-angle flat-top LEDs uniquely mounted on sides of PCB and 12 SMD LEDs mounted in the center of PCB.
