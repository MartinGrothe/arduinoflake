# Arduinoflake

Arduinoflake is an awesome winter decoration that will light up every dark night. It is no ordinary decoration. This frozen looking beauty is Arduino compatible and can be programmed to do whatever you want to! Last but not least it is Open-Source.

## Build your Arduinoflake

The easiest way how to get your own snowflake is to order a DIY kit on my [Tindie Store]. Kit contains professionally manufactured PCBs by PCBway and all compatible components needed to assemble a fully functional Arduinoflake.

The second option is to manufacture the PCB and get all necessary parts yourself. Arduinoflake is Open-Source. Schema and Gerber files are included in this repository. Don't forget to share your creation with me, I would love to see that!
